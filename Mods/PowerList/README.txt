Thanks for using PowerList!
This version of the mod is ported from Harp(API) to Ember(API)
This Mod is mostly made by blendigoose,
but also based off of the original Harp(API) ModMenu by hd28br#6411

This mod originally only let you view data of the mods you have running such as:
Name, Description, Version, and their README.txt

But now it also lets you view your installed APIs and their README.txt!
